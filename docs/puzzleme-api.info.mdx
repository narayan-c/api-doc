The PuzzleMe API offers secure, efficient programmatic access to puzzles created on the PuzzleMe platform and their analytics. Designed for partners and developers, this API enables seamless integration of puzzle content and analytics dashboards into your applications and platforms.

With these APIs, you can:

  - Access puzzles you have created on the PuzzleMe platform.
  - Retrieve detailed analytics about how your puzzles are played on PuzzleMe.

**Getting Started**
To use these APIs, you will need authentication credentials `client_id` and `client_secret`. You can obtain these by contacting product-support@amuselabs.com

**Metering**
We are in the process of introducing usage-based metering for this API suite. While metering is not currently active, we encourage you to design your integration with this in mind. Once metering is enabled, you may be subject to usage limits and billing based on your API consumption.
