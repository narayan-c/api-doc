  title: PuzzleMe API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The PuzzleMe API offers secure, efficient programmatic access to puzzles created on the PuzzleMe platform and their analytics. Designed for partners and developers, this API enables seamless integration of puzzle content and analytics dashboards into your applications and platforms.

    With these APIs, you can:

      - Access puzzles you have created on the PuzzleMe platform.
      - Retrieve detailed analytics about how your puzzles are played on PuzzleMe.

    **Getting Started**
    To use these APIs, you will need authentication credentials `client_id` and `client_secret`. You can obtain these by contacting product-support@amuselabs.com

    **Metering**
    We are in the process of introducing usage-based metering for this API suite. While metering is not currently active, we encourage you to design your integration with this in mind. Once metering is enabled, you may be subject to usage limits and billing based on your API consumption.

      summary: Get leaderboard for a puzzle
      description: |
        Retrieves a list of top plays for a specific puzzle, sorted by score and time.
        The endpoint supports both session-based and API token authentication.

        **Time Range Filtering**
        - Use `from` (inclusive) and/or `to` (inclusive) to filter plays by submission time (ISO 8601 format).
        - If neither is provided, all plays are considered.
        - If only `from` is provided, plays from that time onwards are considered.
        - If only `to` is provided, plays up to that time are considered.
        - If both are provided, plays between `from` and `to` (inclusive) are considered.
        - Timestamps are rounded to the nearest second (contest mode) or minute (non-contest mode).

        **Use Cases:**
        - **Daily/Weekly Leaderboard:** Filter plays for a specific day or week using `from` and `to` parameters. For example, get all plays submitted on January 15th, 2024.
        - **Contest Completion:** When a contest ends, use `to` parameter to freeze the leaderboard at the contest end time, ensuring no plays submitted after the contest are included.
        - **Historical Analysis:** Compare performance across different time ranges by using different `from`/`to` combinations.
        - **Post-Contest Analysis:** After a contest ends, analyze only contest submissions by combining `contestSubmissionsOnly=true` with the contest time window.
